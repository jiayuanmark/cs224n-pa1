cs224n-pa1
==========

The first pa1 of cs244n at Stanford

Notice:
1. Changed line 34 of cs224n.assignments.WordAlignmentTester.java for local development

2. For PMIModel, it seems that we only need to keep track of one conditional probability table.
We need to check Eq. (1) in the write up and double check cs224n.util.Counters.conditionalNormalize.

3. I'm not sure about what I'm doing with NULL alignment. We'll also need to check that.
